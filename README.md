## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use MongoDB as a database and utilize mongoose as an ODM library to build a social network API. The motivation for this project was to learn a new database and ODM library for creating APIs that can be further used in future MERN stack applications. This was created to build an API that demonstrates a fundamental understanding on how to work with MongoDB/Mongoose queries.

## Installation

To install the project, users should open the integrated terminal and install the necessary packages using the following command: 
````
npm i
````
Once all dependencies have been installed, the application is ready to use, and the following terminal command will start the server locally:
````
npm run start
````

## Usage

As this project is a back-end application, client's should use Insomnia, ThunderClient, or a similar API client to test functionality. By using the proper routes, client's may test the API's ability to create/update/delete/view users, add/delete friends, create/update/delete/view thoughts, and create/delete reactions to thoughts. Data created/updated should follow JSON format and adhere to the models created in order to function smoothly. If a user is finished testing the API and wishes to exit from the application, simply press Ctrl+C to terminate the current session.
